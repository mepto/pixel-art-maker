## What this is

This is an exercice made in the context of the Udacity Front-end nanodegree.
[Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/).

It helps to practice your javascript and your pixel art competencies.

## How it works

Choose the size of your grid and a color. Then, click on the grid to add a color to a cell or click and drag to draw more than one cell at once.

Once you're satisfied with your piece, click on the "Transform to image" button. A new window will pop up with your creation in image format, borders-free and save-ready.
